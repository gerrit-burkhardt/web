  I am a psychiatric resident and postdoctoral researcher working at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Ludwig Maximilian University Hospital in Munich. 
  
  ## Research
  
  My research aims at developing personalized neurobiological interventions for the treatment of major depressive disorder and depressive-like symptoms in adults and adolescents. I’m especially interested in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) since they offer patients relatively safe and tolerable treatment options. By using complex modeling techniques like machine learning, I aim to understand the clinical effects of NIBS on an individual patient level. Furthermore, I specialize in conducting early proof-of-principle and confirmatory randomized controlled trials with the aim of translating findings from neurophysiological and neuroimaging research into clinical care. 
  
  ## Grants
