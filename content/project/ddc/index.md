## Abstract

### Background 
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a feasible treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, meta-analytic evidence is heterogenous, and data from multicenter trials are lacking. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of tDCS versus sham stimulation as an add-on to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in adults with MDD. 
### Methods 
The DepressionDC trial was a triple-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial conducted at 8 sites in Germany. Patients (aged 18 to 65 years) with MDD (DSM-5 criteria) were eligible if they had been receiving an SSRI at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks; the SSRI was continued during treatment. Patients were allocated (1:1) by fixed-blocked randomization to receive either 30-minute, 2-mA bifrontal tDCS for 20 consecutive weekdays followed by 2 tDCS sessions a week for 2 weeks or sham stimulation at the same intervals. Randomization was stratified by site and baseline Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (< 31 or ≥ 31). Participants, raters, and operators were masked to treatment assignment. Primary outcome was change on the MADRS at week 6 (analyzed in the intention-to-treat population).

### Findings
Between January 19, 2016, and June 15, 2020, 3601 individuals were assessed for eligibility; 160 were included, and data from 150 were analyzed (89 [59%] women, 61 [41%] men; mean age, 40·1 years [SD 13·4]). No intergroup difference was found in mean improvement on the MADRS at week 6 (active tDCS, n=77, -8·2 [SD 7·2]; sham, n=73, -8·0 [9·3]; difference, 0·3 [95% CI, -2·4 to 2·9]). More adverse events (all of which were mild) occurred with active tDCS.

### Interpretation
Active tDCS was not superior to sham stimulation over a 6-week period. Our trial does not support the efficacy of tDCS as an add-on to SSRIs in adults with MDD.
